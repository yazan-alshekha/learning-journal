# What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

## The Command Line!:
The command line is an interesting beast, and if you've not used one before
 can be a bit daunting. Don't worry, with a bit of practice you'll soon come to see it as your friend.
 Don't think of it as leaving the GUI behind so much as adding to it. While you can leave the GUI alltogether,
 most people open up a command line interface just as another window on their desktop (in fact you can have as many open as you like).
 This is also to our advantage as we can have several command lines open and doing different tasks in each at the same time.We can also easily jump back to the GUI when it suits us
 Experiment until you find the setup that suits you best.
 As an example I will typically have 3 terminals open: 1 in which I do my working, another to bring up ancilliary data and a final one for viewing Manual pages
